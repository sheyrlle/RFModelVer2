"Java has been a bit more challenging. I've struggled with object-oriented programming concepts and debugging, but with practice and persistence, I'm getting better. It's like learning a new language it takes time and effort, but the results are worth it",Normal
"My programming journey has been challenging but rewarding. Java is teaching me the importance of structure. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I can see my progress, and that motivates me to keep improving.",Normal
"Learning Java is fun but when I can't solve problem, my heart aches because I can't push myself to do more.",Weak
"I haven't started learning these language yet, but I'm interested and willing to learn.",Weak
I see Java as a well-structured and disciplined environment. It’s like a meticulously organized library where everything has its place. Python feels like a conversation. Its straightforward syntax and readability make it incredibly intuitive. C is the foundation. It's a low-level language that exposes the raw power and mechanics of a computer. Each language serves a different purpose.,Normal
It's so hard but I enjoy coding,Normal
I would say that it always excite ms me but I'm having a bit of a hard time doing things about it.,Weak
It needs a lot of improvements,Weak
Quite fun and frustrating,Normal
"I feel comfortable working with Java, and I enjoy the challenges it presents.",Strong
it is good enough to make an new product using this language like you need to broad your mind to be that good,Normal
If you fail its ok because you'll grow by doing wrongs and just trust the process,Normal
"It's challenging for me because I don't have any background to those language I need more learnings for me adapt, and to improve my skills",Weak
"My journey in learning Java and Python is exciting and a fun experience, but at the same time, it is tiring and hard to learn. I've faced a lot of challenges, and I still need improvements. For C language, I still need to learn the basics.",Normal
Difficult but I’m enjoying,Normal
"My programming journey in Python, C, and Java has been a mix of challenges and progress, with Python boosting my confidence while C and Java push me to be more patient and persistent.",Normal
Challenging,Weak
"I think it’s like a roller coaster because sometimes, even if you already know what to do when it comes to programming, you can still get confused—especially if you have no knowledge about it at all. But if you are willing to learn how to be good at programming, you will really learn it in an easy way.",Normal
Maybe from now I'm not that good but i know that my teachers will help me to gain more knowledge about programming and coding,Weak
good,Normal
"The journey has been fun so far though with programming having deep terminologies and a different style of learning, I would need to adapt and keep practicing all the time to keep up.",Normal
"Its rocky, I don't really practice much, when I need to do something, that's the only time I'm learning or doing codes.",Weak
It's hard to learn new language but if you keep trying an making project and research solutions and understand them it can be quite fun.,Normal
"Being a programmer doesn't need to be perfect all the time. Sometimes, you need to achieve failure to be better.",Normal
"My journey in learning Java, Python, and C has been a mix of small wins and challenge, while I’ve made progress and gained confidence in some areas, I still encounter tricky concepts that push me to keep practicing and learning.",Normal
"It's kind of difficult, and there are times when it's really hard to understand. Especially the java because it's quite sensitive when it's comes to coding",Weak
"My journey has been challenging but rewarding. Python has been the easiest to learn, Java has helped me understand object-oriented programming, and C has strengthened my logic and problem-solving skills even though it’s harder. Overall, I feel I’m improving step by step.",Normal
It's kinda difficult at first it's like an up side down journey with computer but if you stay focused its a satisfying success.,Normal
"My programming language journey has been very difficult, it's like I was introduced to a new language that I am completely unaware of. I learned the basics, and I struggle with it, so my progress has been slow because I feel like I haven't fully grasped the logic behind coding",Weak
JAVA hurts my head at first. It's like reading a book when you can't read yet(First thing we've learned).,Weak
"C is like reading a book in elementary. It may be hard at first but when you convert your knowledge/ algorithm from JAVA to C, it's actually the same but different in syntax but syntax can be read by a child.",Normal
"PYTHON for me is really easy. Since I have already accuired knowledges on how code works on computer programming, it became an easy way for me to code python. Plus the syntaxes used are on par with java but very easy to ready because it's just english language.",Strong
"My journey for java and python is like a pushing a square shape rock, but i learn how to carve it into a round to make it easier to push (extremely hard to easy). On C i describe it as seed that already planted but not yet received a water. (Potential has not been born).",Normal
It's good because I understand more,Normal
"As first years the i describe java, python and c is not easy as i think yo understand them.",Weak
"My programming journey has been challenging but rewarding, and each language I learn gives me more confidence to tackle bigger problems.",Strong
i’m still a noob when it comes to programming languages but i believe that practices makes it perfect,Weak
Its so amazing when you Master it very interesting things it is,Strong
"learning these languages has been interesting. Python is easier, Java and C is challenging. I want to keep practicing and get better and better.",Normal
I think it challenge me but I can do it,Normal
"My journey while learning this programming languages was slowly lots of trials and error, but I'm learning and willing to improve my skills for my goals and future.",Normal
I am not satisfied with my learning pace and I often forgot syntax easily which makes learning very challenging.,Weak
Self-learning makes you a good programmer,Strong
"My journey feels challenging but meaningful, since coming from HUMSS to BSCS is a big shift, and learning Java and Python has shown me that I can grow even in a field I wasn’t originally trained for.",Normal
These programming languages are easy to learn if I just practice it everyday but due to several distractions it has become a very challenging language in my current college days,Normal
"My journey with Java, Python, and C is a continuous learning process, and I'm always making progress despite my current limitations.",Normal
Since it aligns with my interest I find it very fun and engaging albeit a bit challenging at times especially when incorporating new systems in already built lines of code,Normal
It is hard but if you're enjoying what you do then it will ease the struggles!,Normal
"My programming journey with Java, Python, and C has been full of learning and challenges. Python felt the easiest to pick up, Java taught me discipline in coding, and C pushed me to understand how computers work at a deeper level, even though it was the most difficult for me.",Normal
I say I'm improving because sometimes I can do the task given to me correctly and I keep learning and watching tutorials on how to use that programming language that I'm subject to and sometimes if I don't know what that means or how to use those variables I try to research it.,Normal
Hard,Weak
understanding logic,Normal
